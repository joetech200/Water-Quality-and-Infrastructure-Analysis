# 🌍 Maji Ndogo: Basic Water Access  

## 📌 Project Overview  
Maji Ndogo is a **data-driven analysis** focused on understanding **water accessibility challenges** in underserved communities. Using **Spreadsheets, sql and Power BI**, this project uncovers inefficiencies, corruption, and operational gaps that hinder fair water distribution. The insights derived aim to support **data-backed decision-making** for sustainable water distribution and management.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
- Analyze water distribution trends to identify supply-demand gaps.  
- Uncover corruption and fraudulent activities by employees, affecting fair water access.  
- Provide actionable insights for improving service delivery and infrastructure planning.  
- Develop visual dashboards for stakeholders to monitor water access metrics.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **SQL:** Data cleaning, querying, and fraud detection in water distribution records.  
- **Spreadsheets (Excel/Google Sheets):** Data exploration, pivot tables, and trend analysis.  
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards for data visualization and reporting.  

## 🔍 Key Findings  
- **Supply Gaps:** Some regions receive disproportionately less water than others.  
- **Corruption Exposure:** SQL analysis uncovered inconsistencies in water access record and supply logs, indicating fraudulent employee activities.  
- **Operational Inefficiencies:** Delays in getting water from different water sources due to mismanagement.  
- **Impact on Communities:** Households in the Rural part of the communities suffer the most from irregular water distribution and increased wait time for water.  

## 📊 Data Visualization  
Power BI dashboards were designed to provide **real-time tracking** of water supply trends, billing anomalies, and cost for infrastural development   

## 🚀 How to Use This Project  
1. **SQL Analysis:** Use the provided queries to replicate fraud detection and data validation.  
2. **Spreadsheets:** Explore the dataset and perform custom calculations.  
3. **Power BI Dashboards:** Interact with visual reports to gain deeper insights.  

## 🏆 Impact  
This project highlights the power of **data analytics in social impact** by driving **accountability, transparency, and efficiency** in resource distribution.
